<p>When choosing your roofing material, you want something that will last for years—and provide protection from the elements. But with so many options available, it can be hard to determine which material is best for you.</p>

<p>Indeed, metal roofs and shingle roofs are two popular choices among US homeowners. But before you decide, it's essential to consider the pros and cons of each. In this article—the ultimate comparison of metal vs. asphalt shingles—we'll cover everything from <a href="https://directorii.com/costs/how-much-does-it-cost-to-replace-your-roof-2022/">cost</a> and lifespan to the most popular brands in the US. We'll also provide helpful tips for care and maintenance so you can choose the right roof.</p>

<h2>Durability and Longevity: Metal Roof vs. Asphalt Shingles</h2>

<p>There's a huge difference when comparing the lifespan of metal roofing versus asphalt shingles. Asphalt shingle roofs typically last anywhere from 12 to 20 years, while metal roofs can last up to 50 years (or even longer with proper maintenance).</p>

<p>The difference in longevity can be attributed to several factors. Asphalt shingles are made with organic materials that easily break down over time due to exposure to the elements. On the other hand, metal roofing is made of durable steel or aluminum that can withstand harsh weather conditions and years of wear and tear. In addition, most metal roofing is coated for additional protection against fading, rust, and corrosion—adding even more years to its service life.</p>

<p>And when it comes to the resale value of your home, homeowners often recoup more of their initial cost in resale value by having a metal roof installed rather than an asphalt shingle one.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of Metal Roofs</h2>

<p>When it comes to metal roofing, there are both pros and cons to consider. On the upside, metal roofs typically last longer than asphalt shingle roofs—generally speaking, you can expect a metal roof to last 40-70 years, and in some cases, they can even last up to 100 years. That's quite a long time compared to asphalt shingles that last anywhere from 15-30 years, depending upon the type of shingle and quality of installation.</p>

<p>Metal roofs are also lightweight. This is great because you won't have a lot of extra weight on your home's structure. And finally, metal roofs require very little maintenance and come with lengthy warranty periods (up to 50 years).</p>

<p>The average price for metal roofs, including materials and installation, typically ranges from $7 to $14 per square foot. Factors such as the type of metal used, your location, and the complexity of the installation can cause the price to vary. This means the total cost for a 3,000-square-foot home can range from $21,000 to $42,000.</p>

<p>When it comes to insulation, metal roofs are effective at reflecting heat away from your home on hot summer days. However, they may need to offer more insulation in colder climates, potentially necessitating extra insulation. </p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of Asphalt Shingle Roofs</h2>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/KDkF67t/shutterstock-347979323.jpg" alt="Close-up view of asphalt shingle roofing material on a residential home, highlighting its texture and quality" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 640px; width: 100%;">

<p>Asphalt shingle roofs come with a unique set of pros and cons. Regarding cost, shingle roofs are one of the most affordable roofing materials available today. </p>

<p>Plus, asphalt shingle roofs come in many different types, including:</p>

<ul>
   <li>3-tab</li>
   <li>Architectural</li>
   <li>Luxury</li>
   <li>Composite Shingles</li>
   <li>And more</li>
</ul>

<p>However, one downside to <a href="https://directorii.com/articles/the-4-different-types-of-asphalt-shingles/">asphalt shingle roofing</a> is its shorter lifespan than metal roofs. Additionally, certain climates can cause premature wear due to extreme weather conditions like ice, wind, snow, or rain. Lastly, choosing an asphalt roof would require frequent maintenance and care to last its full lifespan.</p>

<p>The typical cost for installing an asphalt shingle roof ranges from $3.50 to $5.50 per square foot. For a 3,000-square-foot home, a total expense is between $5,140 and $18,374. It's important to note that these costs can fluctuate based on factors like the shingle type, your geographical location, and the intricacy of the installation process.</p>

<p>You may have heard of some famous brands in the US regarding asphalt shingle roofing. These include the likes of GAF, CertainTeed, Owens Corning, and Atlas.</p>

<h3>GAF</h3>

<h2>Which Roofing Material Is Right for You?</h2>

<p>So metal vs. asphalt shingles: what should you choose?</p>

<p>Deciding between metal and asphalt shingles can be difficult, as several factors will influence your choice:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Your financial constraints.</li>
   <li>The weather patterns in your region.</li>
   <li>The level of maintenance you're prepared to undertake.</li>
   <li>The duration of your stay in the property.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>A metal roof will cost more upfront than a traditional shingle roof — it is estimated to be up to two times more expensive. On the other hand, metal roofs tend to last longer than shingle roofs—some metal roofs have been known to last up to 50 years or more—so there will possibly be no need for a total replacement during your tenure in the home. Traditional asphalt roof requires replacement every 15-20 years or less.</p>


<h3>Popular Brands</h3>

<p>Prominent brands such as GAF, CertainTeed, Owens Corning, and Atlas lead the industry when exploring asphalt shingle options. </p>
