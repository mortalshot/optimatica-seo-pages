<p>Choosing a roofing contractor is one of your most important decisions as a homeowner. Along with skill and experience, you want to ensure they offer solid warranties and guarantees to back up their work. But what exactly do these terms mean, and how can you make the most of the coverage?</p>

But before you make your selection, let's dive into what you need to know about warranties and guarantees for roofs—including why they matter and how long they can last.</p>

<h2>Types of Roofing Guarantees: Manufacturer vs. Contractor</h2>

<p>Regarding roofing warranties, there are two main types—manufacturer and contractor warranties.</p>

<p>Manufacturer warranties are extended by the manufacturer of the roofing material used, such as shingle, tile, or membrane. These warranties typically cover defects in the materials that a contractor would not cover, such as premature aging or cracking of the materials.</p>

<p>On the other hand, contractor warranties are provided by your roofing contractor and often cover workmanship issues. These warranties might include <a href="https://directorii.com/articles/how-to-spot-a-leak-in-your-roof/">leaks</a> or other repairs due to improper installation or poor craftsmanship. Contractor warranties may also provide coverage for any damage caused by weather events. However, some roofing jobs may not qualify depending on the type of roof and climate they are installed in.</p>

<p>It's essential to understand what type of warranty coverage you are getting when selecting a roofing contractor to have adequate protection if something goes wrong with your new roof.</p>

<h2>Manufacturer Warranties: How Long Do They Last?</h2>

<p>When researching roofing guarantees, getting overwhelmed with all the terminology and details can be easy. </p>

<p>Manufacturer warranties are one type of warranty you get when installing a new roof. These typically cover defects in materials for a specified period, usually between 10-50 years. The coverage period depends on the material and manufacturer, so make sure to ask your contractor about their specific products and company policy on manufacturer warranties.</p>

<p>In addition to material defects, some manufacturer warranties may cover damage caused by extreme weather or other extreme circumstances such as fires or high winds. Be sure to check with your roofing contractor to get all the details on what's covered by their product warranties—that way, you can rest assured that you have adequate protection for your home in case anything goes wrong.</p>

<h2>Contractor Workmanship Warranties: What Is Covered?</h2>

<p>The third type of roofing warranty you should know is the contractor workmanship warranty. This type of warranty covers any errors or mistakes made during installation.</p>

<p>Typically, these warranties last anywhere between one and five years, but some contractors may offer 10-year workmanship warranties. It's essential to check the details of your specific warranty, as some may only cover certain components and materials used in the roofing project.</p>

<p>So what exactly is covered by a contractor workmanship warranty? Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
   <li>Leak repairs due to faulty installation</li>
   <li>Replacements or repairs needed for underlayment, flashing, or siding due to installation errors</li>
   <li>Damages to shingle material caused by improper installation</li>
   <li>HVAC equipment damaged due to roof replacement</li>
   <li>Damage caused by poor ventilation design and/or incorrect installation</li>
</ul>

<p>It's important to remember that in most cases, damages caused by weather events or natural disasters are not covered by a contractor's workmanship warranty. However, these types of incidents are typically included in a manufacturer's product warranty.</p>

<h2>Limitations of Roofing Warranties and Guarantees </h2>

<p>Regarding roofing warranties and guarantees, there are certain limitations to remember. </p>

<p>Some warranties will partly cover the cost of materials but not labor. </p>

<p>Plus, it's important to remember that warranties often don't include wear and tear from weather or years of extreme temperature changes.</p>

<p>Other warranty limitations you should be aware of include the following:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Some manufacturers may not offer coverage if a certified contractor does not install your roof</li>
   <li>Warranty lengths may vary based on the type of material used</li>
   <li>Some warranties may require regular maintenance checks to remain valid</li>
   <li>Coverage could be void if major repairs are done without consulting the manufacturer first</li>
   <li>Warranty or guarantee reimbursements may take weeks or even months to process</li>
</ol>

<p>The exact terms and conditions of a roofing warranty or guarantee will depend on the manufacturer or contractor you choose—so make sure you read all the fine print before signing anything!</p>

<h2>How to File a Roofing Warranty or Guarantee Claim</h2>

<p>Have you ever had to file a claim because of a roofing warranty or guarantee? Before you do, here are some tips for filing a successful roofing warranty or guarantee claim.</p>

<p><strong>1. Know what is covered in your roofing warranty or guarantee.</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Get a professional evaluation</strong></p>

<p>Having a professional evaluate your roof can give you insight into potential problems that may take time to notice, like minor damage that could become an expensive repair if not taken care of soon. You can even request an inspection to verify that your roof has been installed correctly and meets relevant standards before any warranty period expires.</p>

<p><strong>3. Have all necessary documents ready</strong></p>

<p>Ensure that any relevant documents are handy when filing a claim, such as purchase receipts, warranties, and contracts to help prove that the product was purchased from an authorized dealer or installer.
